##User Experience
- Should I Have them include filename? -No
- Should I be able to take input as to how many days people have already sat?

##Inquires
- Javascript () => functions which must be used in onClick event handlers
- Immutable dics
- Python multiprocessing, like how does that work, this can be really cool
- Best Practices, should I let the user name the file
- Why do we use list on dic.keys()?
