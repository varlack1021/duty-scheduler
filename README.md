#Overview
- This website was made at the request of the Office of Residence Life at the State University of New York. I work for the department as an Resident Assistant (RA) and one of our responsibilities is being on call in the office every night. The traditional way we would schedule shifts is very robust. We would literally go in a circle and pick which shifts we wanted. As can be imagined, this is a very tedious job as this can be very time conusming especially if we are scheduling shifts for months at a time. So I decided to automate the process! What once took hours now takes mere seconds.

#Development
- The algorithm I developed to simulate shift picking aims to even out the amount of days everyone sits and takes into account the days that people do not want to sit (like if someone did not want to sit on their birthday). 
- The output is a formatted excel sheet or word sheet with all the shifts and who is assigned to each shift.

- There are two types of shits, Resident Assistant (RA) shifts and Resident Director (RD) shifts. 

#Usage
- The website allows the user the start and end date for how overall period they want to schedule shifts.
- The user can dynamically enter names and days that each staff member does not want to work
- The user can choose what type of scheduling it is for, either RD or RA
- The output is an excel file for Resident Assistants and a word document for RD's
- Output contains all the shifts, who is sitting what shift and the amount of shifts each person is sitting
